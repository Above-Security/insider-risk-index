# Building a Comprehensive Identity & SaaS Security Framework

## Overview

Identity and access management represents the critical foundation for insider risk mitigation. This playbook guides you through implementing a comprehensive framework that secures identities, governs SaaS applications, and establishes zero trust principles across your organization.

Identity and access management failures are a leading cause of data breaches, with privileged credential compromise representing a significant attack vector. Modern organizations typically use dozens of SaaS applications with varying levels of visibility and control. The Identity pillar accounts for 15% of your overall insider risk posture but serves as a force multiplier for all other security controls.

## Phase 1: Discovery and Assessment (Weeks 1-2)

### Current State Assessment

Begin by conducting a comprehensive inventory of your identity and access landscape:

**Identity Infrastructure Audit:**
```yaml
Identity Systems Assessment:
  - Active Directory domain structure and trust relationships
  - Azure AD/Entra ID configuration and licensing
  - LDAP directories and legacy authentication systems
  - Single Sign-On (SSO) provider capabilities
  - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) deployment status

Account Analysis:
  - Total user accounts and service accounts
  - Privileged account inventory and usage patterns
  - Dormant and stale account identification
  - Shared account usage and justifications
  - External user and contractor access
```

**SaaS Application Discovery:**
Use multiple discovery methods to identify all SaaS applications:

**Discovery Tools and Techniques:**
```bash
# Network-based discovery
- Firewall and proxy logs analysis
- DNS query analysis for SaaS domains
- Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) discovery
- Browser extension monitoring

# Financial discovery
- Credit card and expense report analysis
- Procurement system SaaS vendor review
- IT budget analysis for subscription services

# User discovery
- End-user surveys and interviews
- Department-specific application inventories
- Shadow IT discovery programs
```

**Risk Assessment Framework:**
```yaml
Application Risk Scoring:
  Data Sensitivity (0-25 points):
    - Public information: 5 points
    - Internal business data: 10 points
    - Confidential data: 15 points
    - Regulated data (PII, PHI, PCI): 25 points

  User Population (0-20 points):
    - Department-specific (1-10 users): 5 points
    - Division-wide (11-50 users): 10 points
    - Company-wide (51+ users): 15 points
    - External user access: 20 points

  Integration Level (0-15 points):
    - Standalone application: 5 points
    - API integrations: 10 points
    - Directory synchronization: 15 points

  Compliance Requirements (0-15 points):
    - No specific requirements: 0 points
    - Industry standards: 10 points
    - Regulatory requirements: 15 points

  Total Risk Score: 0-75 (High: 60+, Medium: 30-59, Low: 0-29)
```

### Gap Analysis

Evaluate your current capabilities against best practices:

**Identity Governance Maturity Assessment:**
```yaml
Level 1 - Ad Hoc (0-20 points):

  - Shared privileged accounts
  - No access reviews or certifications

Level 2 - Developing (21-40 points):
  - Basic directory services (Active Directory)
  - Some automated provisioning
  - MFA for admin accounts only
  - Annual access reviews
  - Basic privileged account management

Level 3 - Managed (41-60 points):
  - Identity governance platform deployed
  - Automated user lifecycle management
  - MFA for all users
  - Quarterly access reviews
  - Role-based access control (RBAC)

Level 4 - Advanced (61-80 points):
  - Zero trust architecture implementation
  - Risk-based authentication
  - Continuous access monitoring
  - Automated access decisions
  - Privileged access management (PAM)

Level 5 - Optimized (81-100 points):
