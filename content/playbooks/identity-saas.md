## Core Identity Security Components

### Central Identity Provider (IdP)
- **Single Source of Truth**: Unified user directory and attributes
- **Federation Support**: SAML, OAuth, OpenID Connect protocols
- **Lifecycle Management**: Automated provisioning and deprovisioning
- **Attribute Management**: Rich user profiles and metadata
- **Integration APIs**: Connector frameworks and sync capabilities

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- **Adaptive Authentication**: Risk-based authentication decisions
- **Multiple Factors**: Something you know/have/are combinations
- **Phishing Resistance**: FIDO2/WebAuthn and hardware tokens
- **User Experience**: Seamless and convenient authentication flows
- **Backup Methods**: Recovery codes and alternate authentication

### Privileged Access Management (PAM)
- **Account Discovery**: Automated privileged account identification
- **Password Vaulting**: Secure storage and rotation of privileged credentials
- **Session Management**: Recording and monitoring of privileged sessions
- **Just-in-Time Access**: Temporary elevation and automated de-provisioning
- **Risk Analytics**: Privileged user behavior monitoring and scoring

## SaaS Security Framework

### Application Risk Assessment
- **Data Classification**: Sensitivity levels and regulatory requirements
- **Business Criticality**: Impact assessment and availability requirements
- **User Population**: Access patterns and privilege levels
- **Integration Complexity**: API usage and data flows
- **Vendor Security Posture**: Third-party risk assessment

### OAuth Security Controls
- **Application Approval**: Centralized OAuth app registration and approval
- **Scope Limitation**: Principle of least privilege for API permissions
- **Token Management**: Secure generation, storage, and lifecycle management
- **Consent Flows**: User awareness and administrative oversight
- **Revocation Processes**: Automated and manual token revocation capabilities

### Data Governance
- **Data Loss Prevention**: SaaS DLP policies and monitoring
- **Sharing Controls**: Internal and external sharing restrictions
- **Retention Policies**: Data lifecycle management and disposal
- **Backup and Recovery**: Cloud data protection strategies
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Regulatory adherence and audit trails

## Zero Trust Implementation

### Identity-Centric Security
- **Never Trust, Always Verify**: Continuous authentication and authorization
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal necessary access with regular validation
- **Assume Breach**: Defense in depth with insider threat considerations
- **Context Aware**: Risk-based decisions using multiple signals
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time visibility and response

### Policy-Based Access Control
- **Device Trust**: Managed and compliant device requirements
- **Location Awareness**: Geographic and network-based restrictions
- **Time-Based Access**: Temporal access controls and schedules
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Anomaly detection and risk scoring
- **Application Context**: Resource-specific access policies

## Access Governance Process
