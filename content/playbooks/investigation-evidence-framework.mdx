# Building a Comprehensive Investigation & Evidence Framework

## Overview

Investigation and evidence capabilities are critical for insider risk management, providing comprehensive session reconstruction, immutable evidence collection, and complete user context needed to understand exactly what happened during incidents. This pillar enables organizations to rapidly investigate threats through complete session replay and audit-ready evidence that proves user activities and intent.

According to Gartner's research, 70% of organizations face technical challenges in insider threat management, making robust investigation capabilities essential. Organizations with mature investigation capabilities reduce average containment time from 81 days to 52 days, saving an average of $2.1M per incident (Ponemon Institute, 2025).
