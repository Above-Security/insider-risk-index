- **Network Forensics**: Traffic capture, protocol analysis, communication reconstruction
- **Mobile Forensics**: Smartphone/tablet examination, app data extraction, location analysis
- **Cloud Forensics**: Cloud storage analysis, SaaS data collection, API investigations

### Evidence Collection
- **Preservation**: Immediate response, system isolation, data protection
- **Acquisition**: Bit-for-bit copying, hash verification, metadata preservation
- **Chain of Custody**: Documentation, tracking, access control, integrity verification
- **Legal Admissibility**: Proper procedures, authentication, expert testimony preparation

### Analysis Techniques
- **Timeline Construction**: Event correlation, chronological mapping, gap analysis
- **Data Recovery**: Deleted file reconstruction, fragmented data assembly, encryption breaking
- **Behavioral Analysis**: User activity patterns, anomaly detection, motive assessment
- **Communications Analysis**: Email threading, chat reconstruction, social media investigation

## Investigation Process Framework

### 1. Case Initiation (24-48 hours)
- **Trigger Assessment**: Evaluate alert or report validity
- **Initial Response**: Secure systems, preserve evidence, notify stakeholders
- **Legal Review**: Assess privilege, privacy, and regulatory implications
- **Resource Allocation**: Assign team members, reserve tools, set timeline
- **Documentation**: Create case file, establish tracking, begin chronology

### 2. Evidence Collection (1-2 weeks)
- **System Isolation**: Network disconnection, user access suspension
- **Live Data Capture**: Memory dumps, running processes, open connections
- **Storage Imaging**: Full disk copies, hash verification, chain of custody
- **Cloud Collection**: API access, data downloads, metadata extraction
- **Interview Preparation**: Subject research, question development, legal coordination

### 3. Analysis Phase (2-6 weeks)
