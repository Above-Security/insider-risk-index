# Building Comprehensive Phishing Resilience Program

## Overview

Phishing attacks remain the #1 attack vector for insider risk incidents, with 68% of data breaches involving a human element according to the Verizon 2024 Data Breach Investigations Report. This playbook provides a comprehensive framework for building organizational resilience against phishing and social engineering attacks through layered technical controls, advanced user training, and cultural transformation.

The Phishing Resilience pillar accounts for 15% of your overall insider risk score but serves as the primary gateway for external attackers seeking to exploit internal resources. Organizations with mature phishing resilience programs experience 70% fewer successful social engineering attacks and 45% faster recovery times.
