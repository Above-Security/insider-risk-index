# Phishing Resilience Program Implementation

The Phishing Resilience pillar focuses on building comprehensive organizational defense against phishing and social engineering attacks through layered technical controls, user awareness training, and continuous improvement processes.

## Executive Summary

This playbook provides a comprehensive framework for building organizational resilience against phishing attacks through layered technical controls, user awareness training, and continuous improvement processes that reduce both successful attacks and insider threat risks.

<Alert type="warning">
<strong>Critical Security Note:</strong> Phishing attacks are the primary attack vector for insider threat scenarios, with 68% of breaches involving human elements according to Verizon's 2024 DBIR.
