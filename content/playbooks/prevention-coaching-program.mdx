# Building a Comprehensive Prevention & Coaching Program

## Overview

Prevention and coaching represent the human-centered approach to insider risk management. This playbook guides you through building a comprehensive program that addresses the root causes of insider threats through education, awareness, and positive behavior change.

Research shows that more than 50% of insider incidents lack malicious intent, making prevention and coaching programs essential. Organizations with comprehensive prevention programs reduce incident costs by 31% and experience 27% fewer insider threat events (Ponemon Institute, 2025).

## Phase 1: Foundation and Assessment (Weeks 1-2)

### Current State Assessment

Evaluate your organization's existing security culture and awareness levels:

**Culture Assessment Survey:**
```yaml
Security Awareness Questions:
  - How familiar are you with our information security policies?
  - Can you identify common phishing attempts?
  - Do you know how to report security incidents?
  - How comfortable are you discussing security concerns with management?

Behavioral Questions:
  - How often do you share passwords or accounts?
  - Do you use personal devices for work activities?
  - How do you handle sensitive information when working remotely?
  - What security practices do you follow when traveling?

Attitude Questions:
  - Do you believe security is everyone's responsibility?
  - How do you view security controls (enabler vs. barrier)?
  - Are you aware of insider threat risks in your role?
  - Do you trust the organization's handling of security incidents?
```

**Baseline Metrics Collection:**
- Current phishing click rates and reporting rates
- Security incident frequency and types
- Policy compliance levels and violations
- Employee satisfaction with security measures
- Training completion rates and effectiveness scores

### Program Strategy Development

Define your prevention and coaching strategy:

**Program Objectives:**
1. **Awareness:** Ensure all employees understand security risks and responsibilities
2. **Behavior Change:** Modify risky behaviors through positive reinforcement
3. **Culture Transformation:** Build a security-conscious organizational culture
4. **Skill Development:** Enhance employees' ability to identify and respond to threats
5. **Continuous Improvement:** Establish feedback loops for ongoing program enhancement

**Target Audience Segmentation:**
