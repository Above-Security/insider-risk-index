# Building a Visibility Foundation for Insider Risk Management

## Overview

Visibility is the cornerstone of effective insider risk management. This playbook guides you through establishing comprehensive monitoring and detection capabilities that provide real-time insights into user activities, system access, and data movement across your organization.

According to Gartner's 'Rule of Three' framework, visibility serves as the foundation for detecting the three primary threat types: careless users, malicious users, and compromised credentials. Organizations with mature visibility programs detect insider threats 40% faster than those without (Gartner G00805757, 2024).

## Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (Weeks 1-2)

### Current State Assessment

Begin by conducting a comprehensive assessment of your existing monitoring capabilities:

**Infrastructure Inventory:**
- Document all systems, applications, and data repositories
- Identify critical assets and sensitive data locations
- Map user access paths and privilege levels
- Assess current logging capabilities and retention policies

**Gap Analysis:**
- Compare current capabilities against industry standards
- Identify blind spots in monitoring coverage
- Document compliance requirements (SOX, HIPAA, PCI DSS)
- Assess team skills and training needs

### Architecture Design

Design your visibility architecture with these key components:

**Core Monitoring Stack:**
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system
- User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) platform
- Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solution
- Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools
- Network monitoring and analysis tools

**Integration Requirements:**
- Active Directory and identity systems
- Cloud applications and SaaS platforms
- Database and file servers
- Network infrastructure and firewalls
- Email and collaboration tools

## Phase 2: Core Infrastructure Deployment (Weeks 3-6)

### SIEM Implementation

Deploy and configure your SIEM system for comprehensive log collection:

**Log Source Integration:**
```yaml
Priority 1 (Week 3-4):
  - Windows Domain Controllers
  - Linux/Unix systems
  - Critical applications (ERP, CRM, databases)
  - Network devices (firewalls, switches, routers)
  - Cloud infrastructure (AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Log)

Priority 2 (Week 5-6):
  - SaaS applications (Office 365, Google Workspace)
  - VPN and remote access systems
  - Physical access control systems
  - Backup and archival systems
  - Developer tools and code repositories
```

**Initial Detection Rules:**
- Failed login attempts (5+ failures within 10 minutes)
- Privileged account usage outside business hours
- Bulk data downloads or exports
- Access to sensitive file shares from unusual locations
- New user account creation or privilege escalation

### User Behavior Analytics (UBA)

Establish behavioral baselines for all users and entities:

**Baseline Development Process:**
1. **Data Collection Period:** Collect 30-60 days of normal activity
2. **Profile Creation:** Build individual user profiles including:
   - Login patterns and locations
   - Application usage and access times
   - Data access patterns and volume
   - Email and collaboration behavior
   - Network and system resource usage

3. **Risk Scoring Model:**
   - Assign risk scores based on deviations from baseline
   - Weight factors based on data sensitivity and user role
   - Establish thresholds for alerting and investigation

### Endpoint Monitoring

Deploy endpoint detection capabilities across all devices:

**Deployment Strategy:**
- Start with high-risk users (executives, IT admins, finance team)
- Expand to sensitive departments (R&D, legal, HR)
- Complete organization-wide rollout
- Include contractors and temporary workers

**Key Monitoring Capabilities:**
- File access and modification tracking
- Application usage and installation monitoring
- USB and removable media activity
- Print job tracking and document handling
- Browser activity and download monitoring

## Phase 3: Advanced Analytics and Detection (Weeks 7-10)

### Machine Learning Implementation

Enhance detection capabilities with advanced analytics:

**Anomaly Detection Models:**
- Time-based anomalies (unusual access hours)
- Volume-based anomalies (excessive data access)
- Sequence-based anomalies (unusual activity patterns)
- Peer-group analysis (deviation from role-based norms)
- Geographic anomalies (impossible travel scenarios)

**Model Training and Tuning:**
```python
# Example detection logic for unusual data access
def detect_unusual_data_access(user_activity):
    baseline = get_user_baseline(user_activity.user_id)
    current_volume = user_activity.data_accessed_mb
    
    if current_volume > baseline.average_daily_access * 3:
        risk_score = calculate_risk_score(
            volume_multiplier=current_volume / baseline.average_daily_access,
            data_sensitivity=get_data_classification(user_activity.files),
            user_risk_level=get_user_risk_profile(user_activity.user_id)
        )
        
        if risk_score > ALERT_THRESHOLD:
            generate_alert("unusual_data_access", user_activity, risk_score)
```

### Threat Intelligence Integration

Incorporate threat intelligence to enhance detection:

**Intelligence Sources:**
- Commercial threat feeds (indicators of compromise)
- Industry-specific threat sharing groups
- Government threat bulletins and advisories
- Internal threat intelligence from past incidents

**Integration Points:**
- Email security for malicious domains and attachments
- Network monitoring for command and control communications
- Endpoint detection for known malware signatures
- User behavior analysis for tactics and techniques

### Investigation Workflow

Establish structured investigation processes:

**Alert Triage Process:**
1. **Automated Enrichment:** Gather contextual information
2. **Initial Classification:** Assign priority based on risk score
3. **Analyst Review:** Human validation and preliminary assessment
4. **Investigation Assignment:** Route to appropriate team member
5. **Evidence Collection:** Preserve logs and artifacts
6. **Resolution and Documentation:** Record findings and actions

## Phase 4: Integration and Optimization (Weeks 11-12)

### Dashboard and Reporting

Create executive and operational dashboards:

**Executive Dashboard Metrics:**
- Total insider risk incidents by month
- Mean time to detection and response
- Risk score distribution across the organization
- Compliance status and audit readiness
- Return on security investment calculations

**Operational Dashboard Metrics:**
- Active high-risk users and their activity
- Real-time alert queue and resolution status
- System health and data ingestion rates
- Investigation progress and case status
- Threat landscape and emerging patterns

### Continuous Improvement

Implement ongoing optimization processes:

**Performance Metrics:**
- False positive rates by detection rule
- Time to detection for different threat types
- Investigation efficiency and case closure rates
- User satisfaction with security controls
- Compliance audit results and findings

**Optimization Activities:**
- Weekly detection rule tuning sessions
