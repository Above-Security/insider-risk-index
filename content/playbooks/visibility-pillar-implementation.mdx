# Visibility Pillar Implementation Playbook

The Visibility pillar focuses on implementing comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities to detect insider threats through behavioral analysis, access monitoring, and data movement tracking.

## Executive Summary

This playbook provides a step-by-step approach to implementing visibility controls that enable organizations to monitor user activities, establish behavioral baselines, and detect anomalous behavior that could indicate insider threats.

<Alert>
<strong>Important:</strong> Implementing visibility controls must balance security needs with privacy requirements. Ensure all monitoring activities comply with applicable privacy laws and organizational policies.

## Phase 1: Foundation

### Asset Inventory and Data Classification

#### 1.1 Identify Critical Assets

Create a comprehensive inventory of systems and data that require monitoring:

- **High-Value Systems**
  - Database servers containing sensitive data
  - File servers with intellectual property
  - Email systems and communication platforms
  - Development environments and source code repositories
  - Financial systems and customer databases

- **User Access Points**
  - Workstations and laptops
  - Mobile devices
  - VPN endpoints
  - Cloud service access points
  - Privileged access workstations

- **Network Infrastructure**
  - Domain controllers and authentication systems
  - Network appliances and security devices
  - Cloud infrastructure components
  - API gateways and web applications

#### 1.2 Data Classification

Classify data based on sensitivity and insider threat risk:

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Classification</th><th>Examples</th><th>Monitoring Priority</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Critical</td><td>Customer PII, financial data, trade secrets</td><td>High</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sensitive</td><td>Employee records, internal communications</td><td>Medium</td></tr>
<tr><td>Internal</td><td>Policies, procedures, internal documentation</td><td>Low</td></tr>
<tr><td>Public</td><td>Marketing materials, public announcements</td><td>Minimal</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Privacy and Legal Review

#### 1.3 Legal Framework Assessment

- Review applicable privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, etc.)
- Assess employee monitoring regulations
- Document legitimate business interests
- Establish data retention policies
- Create employee notification procedures

#### 1.4 Policy Development

Create comprehensive monitoring policies covering:

- **Purpose and scope** of monitoring activities
- **Types of data** collected and monitored
- **Retention periods** for different data types  
- **Access controls** for monitoring data
- **Employee rights** and notification procedures
- **Incident response** procedures

## Phase 2: Deployment

### SIEM and Log Management

#### 2.1 SIEM Platform Selection

Choose a SIEM solution based on organizational needs:

**Enterprise Solutions:**
- Splunk Enterprise Security
- IBM QRadar
- Microsoft Sentinel
- Elasticsearch (ELK Stack)

**Key Capabilities Required:**
- Real-time log ingestion and correlation
- User behavior analytics
- Advanced search and reporting
- Integration with existing security tools
- Scalability for organizational growth

#### 2.2 Log Source Configuration

Configure comprehensive log collection:

**Windows Environment:**
```powershell
# Enable advanced auditing
auditpol /set /category:"Account Logon" /success:enable /failure:enable
auditpol /set /category:"Account Management" /success:enable /failure:enable
auditpol /set /category:"Detailed Tracking" /success:enable /failure:enable
auditpol /set /category:"Object Access" /success:enable /failure:enable
auditpol /set /category:"Policy Change" /success:enable /failure:enable
auditpol /set /category:"Privilege Use" /success:enable /failure:enable
auditpol /set /category:"System" /success:enable /failure:enable
```

**Linux Environment:**
```bash
# Configure auditd for comprehensive logging
# Add to /etc/audit/audit.rules

# Monitor file access
-w /etc/passwd -p wa -k identity
-w /etc/shadow -p wa -k identity  
-w /etc/sudoers -p wa -k identity

# Monitor system calls
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -k exec
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S execve -k exec

# Monitor network connections
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S connect -k network
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S connect -k network
```

#### 2.3 Essential Log Sources

Configure collection from critical sources:

- **Authentication Logs**
  - Active Directory authentication events
  - VPN connection logs
  - SSH authentication attempts
  - Web application login events
  - Multi-factor authentication logs

- **File Access Logs**
  - File server access logs
  - Database query logs
  - SharePoint/collaboration platform logs
  - Cloud storage access logs
  - Email system logs

- **Network Activity Logs**
  - Firewall connection logs
  - Proxy server logs
  - DNS query logs
  - Network flow data (NetFlow, sFlow)
  - Wireless access point logs

- **Endpoint Logs**
  - Process execution logs
  - Registry modification logs
  - USB device insertion logs
  - Application installation logs
  - PowerShell execution logs

### User Behavior Analytics (UBA)

#### 2.4 Baseline Establishment

Implement UBA to establish normal behavior patterns:

**Data Collection for Baselines:**
- Login patterns (time, location, frequency)
- File access patterns (types, volumes, timing)
- Network usage patterns
- Application usage patterns
- Email communication patterns

**Baseline Period:**
- Minimum 30 days for initial baselines
- 90 days preferred for comprehensive patterns
- Continuous learning and adaptation
- Seasonal adjustments for business cycles

#### 2.5 Anomaly Detection Rules

Create detection rules for insider threat indicators:

**Access Pattern Anomalies:**
- Unusual login times or locations
- Access to unfamiliar systems or data
- Elevated privilege usage
- Dormant account activity
- Failed authentication spikes

**Data Movement Anomalies:**
- Large data downloads or transfers
- Access to data outside normal job function
- Unusual email attachment patterns
- Cloud storage upload spikes
- Removable media usage

**Behavioral Anomalies:**
- Significant changes in work patterns
- Access to HR or financial systems
- Searches for sensitive information
- Policy violation patterns
- Unusual network connections

## Phase 3: Enhancement

### Advanced Correlation and Analytics

#### 3.1 Correlation Rule Development

Develop sophisticated correlation rules:

**Example: Suspicious Data Access Pattern**
```sql
-- SIEM correlation rule pseudocode
SELECT user, COUNT(DISTINCT file_path) as unique_files
FROM file_access_logs 
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL 1 DAY
  AND file_path CONTAINS sensitive_keywords
GROUP BY user
HAVING unique_files > normal_threshold * 3
```

**Example: Off-Hours Activity Detection**
```sql
-- Detect unusual off-hours activity
SELECT user, system, COUNT(*) as activity_count
FROM authentication_logs
WHERE HOUR(timestamp) NOT BETWEEN 6 AND 22  -- Outside business hours
  AND DAYOFWEEK(timestamp) BETWEEN 2 AND 6   -- Weekdays only
  AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL 7 DAYS
GROUP BY user, system
HAVING activity_count > 5
```

#### 3.2 Machine Learning Integration

Implement ML-based detection capabilities:

- **Unsupervised Learning** for anomaly detection
- **Clustering** to identify user behavior groups  
- **Time Series Analysis** for pattern recognition
- **Risk Scoring** based on multiple factors

### Dashboard and Reporting

#### 3.3 Executive Dashboards

Create high-level visibility dashboards:

- **Risk Score Trending** over time
- **Top Risk Users** and activities
- **Policy Violation Summary**
- **Incident Response Metrics**
- **Compliance Status** indicators

#### 3.4 Analyst Workbenches

Develop detailed investigation interfaces:

- **User Timeline Views** showing all activities
