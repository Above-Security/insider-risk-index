# Above Security

**See intent. Stop risk. Right now.**
Above gives organizations real-time intelligence on user intent and risky behavior — so they can coach good people before they make mistakes, catch bad actors before data walks out the door, and hand off clear evidence when it matters.

## What is Above?

**Above** is an endpoint-native insider protection platform that shows what users actually do *inside apps* — across SaaS, internal, and custom apps — and intervenes in the moment to prevent data loss and misuse. Powered by **LLM-based semantic analysis**, Above understands **intent**, not just clicks, and nudges users in-session to change outcomes without blocking.

# Get people to do the right thing and reduce the number of incidents caused by employees - not through education, rather through direct response to real time behavior and interventions. Reduce the workload because we stop the incident before it becomes incident.

**No integrations. No waiting.**

**Above Security** is the real-time insider risk platform that understands user intent and stops data loss in the moment by surfacing signals when trusted users do risky things like phishing fallout, access misuse, unusual data pulls, risky third-party grants, and role drift.

Above observes behavior inside SaaS, internal, and custom apps, using **LLM-based semantic analysis** to read *why* a user acts—not just what they click—and nudges in-flow to change outcomes without breaking work.

**This delivers:**

* **Fewer incidents** caused by employees — not through training, but through real-time interventions
* **Reduced analyst workload** by stopping issues before they escalate
* **Proactive protection** vs. reactive logs or brittle DLP
* **Frictionless deployment** with no agents, no integrations, no waiting
* **Evidence collection** for clean handoff to Legal & HR

## Assess Risk

**Quantify intent risk with full session context.**
Above captures live user activity and business context to surface who’s at risk, why, and where to act first.

* Dynamic intent-risk scoring from real session behavior
* Cohort views by team, role, and pattern
* Drill-down timelines that explain *what happened and why*

---

## Shape Behavior

**Change outcomes in the moment.**
Coach users exactly when risk appears — right in their workflow.

* Real-time, in-session nudges before risky actions complete
* Playbooks for Shadow SaaS, OAuth abuse, AI misuse, exfiltration, and phishing
* Precision guidance that reduces friction without heavy-handed blocks

---

## Ensure Compliance

**Prove control with audit-ready evidence.**
Turn live session intelligence into clear, defensible records.

* Full session reconstruction and immutable logs
* MFA hygiene checks and policy alignment (HIPAA, ISO, PCI)
* Evidence packs your auditors, HR & investigators — can trust

---

## How It Works

**See** — Capture live session behavior on the agent across SaaS and custom apps.
**Understand** — LLMs separate normal work from risky intent (Shadow SaaS, OAuth abuse, AI misuse, exfiltration, phishing).
**Guide** — Real-time nudges change behavior without blocking or breaking flow.
**Prove** — Audit-ready logs and replay for HIPAA, ISO, PCI — with clear, actionable evidence.

---

## Why Above

Traditional tools stop at authentication or stitched logs. Above protects the gap **between access and action** — where insider risk actually happens — with the context, precision, and speed only a true endpoint-level sensor can deliver.

---

## Outcomes

* Fewer incidents because risky actions are coached away in real time
* Faster investigations with complete session evidence
* Less noise than logs, less friction than blocking — and measurable behavior change

---

## Built for Security Teams

* **CISOs** — Prove control over insider risk without crushing productivity
* **SecOps & IR** — See what happened, when, and why — instantly
* **Compliance** — Turn real-time behavior guidance into audit-ready records

---

## Where It Helps (Right Away)

* **Data Loss & Exfiltration** — Risky downloads, pastes, uploads, and shares detected in context
* **Shadow SaaS & OAuth Abuse** — Unsanctioned apps and risky grants surfaced as they occur
* **AI & Policy Misuse** — Sensitive prompts and outputs caught before they leave the org
* **Sophisticated Phishing** — Detect credential harvesting, payload delivery, and social-engineering pages in real time using LLM-based page inspection
* **LOTS Phishing (Living Off Trusted Services)** — Catch phishing hosted on legitimate platforms (Google Drive, Dropbox, Microsoft 365, etc.) by analyzing page content and behavior, not just domains
* **MFA Hygiene & Session Integrity** — Weak factors and suspicious session patterns identified early

---

## Deployment & Privacy

* **Invisible rollout** — Works from the agent without complex integrations
* **Broad coverage** — SaaS, internal, and custom apps — including homegrown tools
* **Privacy by design** — Policy-aware capture, least-privilege access, and redaction safeguards

## Features

- Excessive personal use during work hours
- Downloading unauthorized or risky software
- Authorizing unsanctioned third-party applications
- Sharing floating or shared credentials
- Falling for advanced phishing that bypasses traditional defenses (e.g., phishing hosted on trusted services — LOTS)
- Authorizing OAuth misuse through over-permissioned consents
- Payroll staff accessing sales or deal data — cross-role access anomalies
- Operating without MFA on sensitive systems
- Inappropriate or high-risk web browsing activity
- Shadow AI tools circumventing approved workflows
- Data staging or hoarding pre-departure
- Circumventing monitoring and logging controls
