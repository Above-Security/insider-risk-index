    definition: "A centralized facility where security professionals monitor, detect, analyze, and respond to cybersecurity incidents on a 24/7 basis.",
    longExplanation: "SOCs are critical for insider threat management as they provide the infrastructure and processes for continuous monitoring and incident response. Modern SOCs use SIEM, UEBA, and threat intelligence platforms to detect insider threats. According to Ponemon Institute's 2025 research, organizations with mature SOCs reduce insider threat containment time to an average of 81 days compared to 91 days without dedicated security operations capabilities.",
