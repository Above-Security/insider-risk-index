/* PHILOSOPHY */

We believe insider threats are one of the most challenging security problems organizations face.
Our mission is to democratize access to world-class insider threat assessment capabilities.
Security should be measurable, actionable, and accessible to organizations of all sizes.
Privacy and trust are fundamental - we never compromise on data protection.
Continuous improvement through research, feedback, and real-world validation.

/* NOTES */

Built with care by security professionals who understand the challenges firsthand.
Every feature is designed based on real-world security needs and user feedback.
We're committed to keeping the core assessment free and accessible.
Open to partnerships, research collaborations, and community contributions.

This project represents hundreds of hours of research, development, and testing.
We hope it helps make the internet a safer place, one organization at a time.
